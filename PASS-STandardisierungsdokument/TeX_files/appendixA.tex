			\item DataDescribingComponent ; SRN: 055 \\ \textit{Subject-Oriented PASS Process Models are in general about describing the activities and interaction of active entities. Yet these interactions are rarely done without data that is being generated by activities and transported via messages. While not considered by Börger's PASS interpreter, the community agreed on adding the ability to integrate the means to describe data objects or data structures to the model and enabling their connection to the process model. It may be defined that messages or subject have their individual $DataObjectDefinition$ in form of a $SubjectDataDefinition$ in the case of $FullySpecifiedSubject$s and \\ $PayloadDataObjectDesfinition$ in the case of \\ $MessageSpecifications$ In general, it expected that these \\ $DataObjectDefinition$ list on or more data fields for the message or subject with an internal data type that is described via a $DataTypeDefinition$. There is a rudimentary concept for a simple build-in data type definition closely oriented at the concept of ActNConnect. Otherwise, the principle idea of the OWL standard is to allow and employ existing or custom technologies for the serialized definition of data structures \\ ($CustomOrExternalDataTypeDefinition$) such as XML-Schemata (XSD), according elements with JSON or directly the powerful expressiveness of OWL itself.}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item DataObjectDefinition ; SRN: 056 \\ \textit{Data Object Definitions are model elements used to describe that certain other model elements may posses or carrier Data Objects.\\ E.G. a message may carrier/include a Business Objects.

				\item InputPoolConstraint ; SRN: 070 \\ \textit{Subjects do implicitly posses input pools.\\
					During automatic execution of a PASS model in a work-flow engine this message box is filled with messages.\\
					Without any constraints models this message in-box is assumed to be able to store an infinite amount of messages.\\
					For some modeling concepts though it may be of importance to restrict the size of the input pool for certain messages or senders.\\This is done using several different Type of InputPoolConstraints that are attached to a fully specified subject.\\Should a constraint be applicable, an "InputPoolConstraintHandlingStrategy" will be executed by a work-flow engine to determine what to do with the message that does not fit in the pool.\\
					Limiting the input pool for certain reasons to size 0 together with the InputPoolConstraintStrategy-Blocking is effectively modeling that a communication must happen synchronously instead of the standard asynchronous mode.

						E.g. as long as a customer has non non-fulfilled request of any type he may not place messages}
				\end{itemize}
				\item InputPoolContstraintHandlingStrategy ; SRN: 074 \\ \textit{Should an InputPoolConstraint be applicable, an "InputPoolConstraintHandlingStrategy" will be executed by a work-flow engine to determine what to do with the message that does not fit in the pool.\\
					There are types of HandlingStrategies. \\
					InputPoolConstraintStrategy-Blocking - No new message will be adding will need to be repeated until successful \\
					InputPoolConstraintStrategy-DeleteLatest - The new message will be added, but the last message to arrive before that applicable to the same constraint will be overwritten with the new one. (LIFO deleting concept)\\
					InputPoolConstraintStrategy-DeleteOldest - The message will be added, but the earliest message in the input pool applicable to the same constraint will be deleted (FIFO deleting concept)\\
					InputPoolConstraintStrategy-Drop - Sending of the message succeeds. However the new message will not be added to the in-box. Rather it will be deleted directly.}

		hasFeelExpressionAsDataMapping & Domain: &  &See \url{https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN} for specification of Feel-Statement-Strings
		
		The idea of these expression is to map data fields from and to the internal Data storage of a subject &\\
		& Range: &  & &\\
		\hline
		hasGraphicalRepresentation & Domain: &  & The process models are in principle abstract graph structures. Yet the visualization of process models is very important since many process models are initially created in a graphical form using a graph editor that was created to foster human comprehensibility. If available any process element may have a graphical representation attached to it&\\

		\hline
		hasModelComponentLabel & Domain: &  &The human legible label or description of a model element. &\\
		& Range: &  & &\\
		\hline
		hasPriorityNumber & Domain: &  &Transitions or Behaviors have numbers that denote their execution priority in situations where two or more options could be executed.
		
		This is important for automated execution.
		
		E.g. when two messages are in the in-box and could be followed, the message denoted on the transition with the higher priority (lower priority number) is taken out and processed.
		
		Similarly, SubjectBehaviors with higher priority (lower priority number) are to be executed before Behaviors with lower priority. &\\
		& Range: &  & &\\
		\hline
		hasReoccuranceFrequenyOrDate & Domain: &  &A data field meant for the two classes ReoccuranceTimeOutTransition and ReoccuranceTimeOutExitCondition.
		
		ToDo: Define the according data format for describing the iteration frequencies or reoccurring dates. Opinion: rather complex: expressive capabilities should cover expressions like: "every 2nd Monday of Month at 7:30 in Morning." Every 29th of July" or "Every Hour", "ever 25 Minuets" , "once each day", "twice each week" etc &\\
		& Range: &  & &\\
		\hline
		hasSVGRepresentation & Domain: &  & The Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) XML format is a text based standard to describe vector graphics.
		
		Adding according image information as XML literals is therefor a suitable, yet not necessarily easily changeable option to include the graphical representation of model elements in the an OWL file.&\\
		& Range: &  & &\\

		& Range: &  & &\\
		\hline
		hasToolSpecificDefinition & Domain: &  & This is a placeholder DataProperty meant as a tie in point for tool vendors to include tool specific data values/properties into models.
		
		By denoting their own data properties as sub-classes to this one the according data fields can easily be recognized as such. However, this is only an option and a place holder to remind that something like this is possible.&\\
