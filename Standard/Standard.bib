	Abstract = {One prerequisite of cross-organizational business processes are well-defined
	models of the organizational structure of the involved companies.
	But in reality maintaining these organizational models is difficult.
	That is because of the constant change happening in companies. Actors
	can be sick. They can leave, join or move within the organization.
	This leads to a constant effort for keeping the organizational models
	valid to policies. This paper describes a novel approach for modeling
	organizations as multidimensional graphs. Policies are represented
	as relations of user-defined types and as predicates. They are taken
	into account when resolving actors. The predicates restrict relations
	and consequently actor assignments. This leads to organizational
	models that conform to policies in intra- and cross-organizational
	business processes.},
