# Standard document for PASS (Partily Obsolete)

These documents contain the standard description (meta-model) for the subject-oriented modeling language PASS. 

The Web Ontology Lanague (OWL) is used to specify the structure (standard_PASS_ont_v_1.0.0.owl)  and Abstarct state machine (ASM) notation is used to define the execution semantic.

Thomas Schallers method fpr describing organisational structures is used for describing the implementation context of a subject oriented model

Note the LateX-Book Projekt in Folder "standard" is obsolete. The projekt has been moved to its own GitHub projekt that is interlinked with Overleaf for shared editing.
